Igaro App is a complete web-app (SPA+) architecture using ES5/6 Javascript, and zero dependencies.

**"It's an architecture, not a framework."**

Ever envisaged a website where rendering and management is client side and server(s) only provide data? An architecture which never has you weighing up whether to reload a fragment or several, and refreshing the page?

## Repo = App = Live Demo

The repo you download here is the App you'll have running on your local machine, and which is continuously deployed to: [http://app.igaro.com](http://app.igaro.com)

## Documentation

This project uses readable code, devoid of callbacks or closure abuse. Code flows like the writing on a page (Promises are used everywhere), and so JSDoc is not required. Instead, all modules and functions are comprehensibly documented in the /modules section.
