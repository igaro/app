#Igaro App [http://app.igaro.com](http://app.igaro.com)

Igaro App is a complete single page application stack using Javascript. It's 100% free.

What do Angular, Backbone and React all have in common? The answer is they extend HTML. While this works well for HTML pages that require a bit of interaction, once you build something significant - like an SPA - you realise just how ineffective these frameworks are. Igaro App on the other hand isn't. It's built from the ground up to do away with HTML, and it's fully object orientated, asynchronous, event driven, modular, lazy loading and so well engineered it doesn't require weakmaps to thwart memory leaks or a virtual DOM to encapsulate mess. You've seen nothing like it. 

Documentation is online and also forms the basis of the github repo you download locally. You'll instantly have an App to modify to your own requirements, ready to deploy anywhere

## Igaro 1.00 Beta Merged!

The igaro100 branch had pulled too far ahead of master and has been merged. Module documentation is still being updated. Translators are required - can you help?
