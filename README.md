#Igaro App [http://app.igaro.com](http://app.igaro.com)

Igaro App is a complete web application stack which does away with HTML. Just pure Javascript and SASS.

Embed into a website, run from a USB stick, or serve via an App store (Cordova ready).

Igaro App is fast, secure, modular and featured. It's designed for developers and engineers rather than lesser programmers that need everything 'HTML easy'. It provides common modules loaded via an ondemand load system and conforms to ECMA standards. It doesn't wrap protoyping into factories or attempt to rewrite Javascript, and it's so well engineered it doesn't need a virtual DOM to encapsulate messy structure. 

* Object Orientated with no global variables. 
* Event Driven, Async with A+ Promises.

## Igaro 1.00 Preview!
