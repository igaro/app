msgid "Igaro App is <b>100%</b> asynchronous, using Promises."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Igaro App most functions dispatch an event at the end of execution which "
"includes a reference to itself and a value. While events are synchronous in "
"chain and hierarchy, each event may contain asynchronous code. This is why "
"most functions return a Promise."
msgstr ""

msgid "Promise Standard"
msgstr ""

msgid "Standard Promises (ES6, A+) are used throughout."
msgstr ""

msgid "Learn More"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sequencing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unfortunately Promises can become verbose, especially for sequencing "
"(applying the output from multiple Promises in the order they were supplied "
"in). While future versions of Javascript attempt to address this, a standard "
"is many years away."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To assist, many instance modules provide pluralized creation functions, i.e ."
"addItem() and addItems(), and core.router provides .addSequence()."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Igaro App's event management system is cleaner than Object.observe() and "
"signficiantly faster than any other framework's implementation. Events are "
"linked to dependencies, which can be other objects or DOM elements and are "
"automatically released, avoiding memory leaks by removing circular "
"references and allowing Javascripts garbage collector to do it's job. The "
"entire process is automatic."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bless"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Igaro App's bless decorates standard javascript objects providing two-way "
"parent-child event management, managers, dependency tracking, abstraction, "
"shared routines and dynamic functions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Most objects bless themselves, and most objects in Igaro are blessed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Usage"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Blessing an object is straight forward. Many attributes are within the <b>o</"
"b> literal and are passed through. See the core.object module for what this "
"literal may contain."
msgstr ""

msgid "The .asRoot flag will be covered in the next chapter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parent"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A reference to a parent object is stored on the child (while this introduces "
"a circular dependency, it's taken care of when the object destructs)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Name"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An object is given a name which can be used to uniquely identify it or it's "
"type. Not to be confused with instanceof!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Path"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A path is used to identify the objects location by way of it's hierarchical "
"position. It's built using the name. Although an object may belong to "
"another it's path may stop at the child, it doesn't necessarily have to "
"resolve all the way to root. This is one usage of the .asRoot flag."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stash"
msgstr ""

msgid "Holds data that may not be attributes of the object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Managers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A manager is a module that uses the blessed decorations to enhance the way "
"the original routines work. Common managers include events, debugging, "
"object creation and dom. Additional managers can be supplied at time of "
"blessing, i.e if the module requires a store. Any module can be a manager."
msgstr ""

msgid "Helpers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a container is provided, helpers will be added to the object. These "
"include show/hide and disable/inert."
msgstr ""

msgid "Destructor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A destructor is appended which when called will wipe dependencies, circular "
"references, children, dom elements and events and will fire an event "
"allowing dependents to do the same."
msgstr ""

msgid "Provides"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What bless provides for an object depends on what was available and passed "
"to it at the point of blessing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compatibiity"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Igaro App is compatible with all modern web browsers and mobile devices."

msgid "Igaro App is <b>100%</b> HTML free."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<s>.getElementById, .getElementsByClassName, .getElementsByTagName, ."
"querySelector[all]</s> are designed for HTML and are slow. Don't use them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Templates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Igaro App has no template engine, instead it uses routes to build entire "
"pages and partials, and excellent CSS for design and layout."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Eliminating HTML results in smarter code, consistency, higher rendering "
"performance and no need for data binding."
msgstr ""

msgid "core.dom"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Shorthand DOM element creation and appendation are provided by the core.dom "
"module. Blessed objects gain a core.dom manager, which handles dependency "
"tracking (i.e .destroy() your model and the dom elements disappear)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The .mk() function provided by core.dom creates elements, appends (or "
"inserts before or after), sets content (can be a language literal) or "
"appends other elements into it, and either sets the className or accepts a "
"function for more power."
msgstr ""

msgid "Events"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is <b>100%</b> event driven."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"core.events is responsible for event management. It provides a manager to "
"core.object's bless, and this is used extensively throughout the Igaro App "
"framework."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Typically taken from the object path attribute, as defined by core.object's "
"bless."
msgstr ""

msgid "Typically matches the name of the executing function."
msgstr ""

msgid "Target"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Defines if any event is for a particular object. Using the event manager "
"provided by core.object's bless sets this automatically to the object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dependencies"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Allows the event to be cleaned/deregistered when any of the dependencies are "
"destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Value"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any value passed to the event and a reference to the target if applicable."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Dispatch"
msgstr ""

msgid "Parent & Children"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When an event dispatches on a child it propagates up through the parent. A "
"rejected Promise or a literal containing stopPropagation can abort this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As the event propagates the path and name change. This allows parents to "
"listen for child events. For example an object with parent 'materials' of "
"name 'metal' which dispatches an event of 'cut' of value true, will also "
"dispatch an event on 'materials' called 'metal.cut'. The value will be "
"replaced with a child reference and original value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The .asRoot() flag prevents a child event dispatching on the parent. It is "
"mostly used by instances. A parent has no need for these dispatches since it "
"can access the instance event manager directly."
msgstr ""

msgid "By Instance/Singleton"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Listening to events on modules is accomplished by accessing the event "
"manager on the object and calling extend on it. This adds your object as a "
"dependency (should it later be destroyed the event will be cleaned up "
"automatically)."
msgstr ""

msgid "(object).managers.event.extend(this).on('eventName',fn);"
msgstr ""

msgid "By Path/Type"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Listening to the event manager on an instance will only provide events for "
"that particular instance, not the instance type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this App, each time an instance.r start and end event fire we keep a "
"tally and display an icon in the header. This is an example of monitoring by "
"type and is accomplished via core.events, not through a manager. View route."
"header.js and take a look at the code used to do this."
msgstr ""

msgid "app['core.events'].on('instance.xhr','start',fn);"
msgstr ""

msgid "Features"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro's architecture is build on several core principles;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Javascript specification must be adhered to. No duplicity and always use "
"standards."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"HTML is a design language ill suited for dynamic operation. Therefore, use "
"no HTML."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Child objects should be able to communicate with parent objects and thus "
"events should fire up a hierarchy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most functions have a potential to be asynchronous, or emit an event which "
"may be so, therefore they should return Promises."
msgstr ""

msgid "From these the foundation on which your app is built will feature;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Flexability - expand functions without appending code into them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Design - built on DOM, not HTML templating and slow parsing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Encapsulation - code is compartmentalized and abstracted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Security - no memory leaks or public variables."
