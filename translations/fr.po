msgid "Asynchronous"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Igaro App is an asynchronous framework using Promises and Event Management "
"to manage delayed notification and value convergence. Callbacks are a thing "
"of the past, and most functions in Igaro App return Promises rather than "
"values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most functions dispatch an event at the end of execution which while "
"sychronous in terms of a chain may contain asynchronous operations. Step-"
"over execution should only occur once registered handles for the event "
"complete hence requiring a Promise to be returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Functions modified at a later date to include asynchronous code break "
"callers that expect a value. For compatibility with future code it is better "
"to return a Promise even if the operation is not currently asynchronous."
msgstr ""

msgid "Promises"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Standard Promises (ES6, A+) are used to replace callback routines. Promises "
"allow for chainable asynchronous operation with error control and are native "
"to modern browsers. Older browsers have a polyfill library loaded "
"automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid "Event Management"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Promises are for objects initiating work, not for objects wishing to be "
"notified when the state of the work has changed. To provide this feature "
"Igaro App uses a complex and powerful event management system. Data and "
"identifiers are returned to each registered party and are propagated "
"vertically through parent objects. It works similarily to the native DOM "
"event system, but it's for objects not elements!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Igaro App's event management system is cleaner than Object.observe() and "
"signficiantly faster than any other framework's implementation. Events are "
"linked to dependencies, which can be other objects or DOM elements and are "
"automatically released, avoiding memory leaks by removing circular "
"references and allowing Javascripts garbage collector to do it's job. The "
"entire process is automatic."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bless"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An integral feature of Igaro App is how it can decorate standard objects to "
"enhance the parent-child relationship, to aid in dependency tracking, and to "
"cut down on duplicate code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An object is responsible for blessing itself and does so via the core.bless "
"module. Note: no prototypes are added onto the object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parent"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A reference to the parent is stored on the child (while this introduces a "
"circular dependency, it's taken care of when the object destructs)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Name & Path"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An object is given a name which can be used to uniquely identify it or it's "
"type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A path is used to identify the objects location by way of it's hierarchical "
"position."
msgstr ""

msgid "Managers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A manager is a module that uses the blessed decorations to enhance the way "
"the original routines work. For example when an object throws an error it is "
"passed all up the hierarchy by way it's parent. Events then fire an error "
"for each parental object but change the name/path. A parent can thus watch "
"for child errors, even for a particular child."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Common managers include events, debugging, object creation and dom. "
"Additional managers can be supplied at time of blessing, i.e if the module "
"requires a store. Any module can be a manager."
msgstr ""

msgid "Destructor"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A blessed object gains a universal destructor which when called will wipe "
"out dependencies, circular references, children, dom elements and events."
msgstr ""

msgid "Design"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This page explains a little bit about the design principles employed in "
"Igaro App (by Design, we're talking about what you see on a page)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After reading this information we strongly recommend looking at the code "
"used to generate this page."
msgstr ""

msgid "Templates"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Igaro App has no template engine, relying instead on reuseable modules and "
"first-class CSS to define layout, not just design."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Separating designers and developers by having designers generate HTML and "
"CSS and developers insert the logic is nothing new, but in reality designers "
"end up producing questionable code which doesn't work well with logic, and "
"developers playing catch up while overly frustrated at the way the design "
"doesn't cater for logic they need to stick in."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With Igaro App designers write routes, style it in CSS and hand it over for "
"logic insertion. In other words, both use the same technology. Both are "
"literally, on the same page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For widgets, or reusable code, developers write the code and designers style "
"it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, this method renders much faster. It's one of the reasons why Igaro "
"App is so fast."
msgstr ""

msgid "core.dom"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Shorthand DOM element creation and appendation are provided by core.dom. "
"Blessed objects gain a core.dom manager which handles dependency tracking (i."
"e .destroy() your model and the dom elements disappear)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The DOM is only used for output, it isn't traversed. These functions are "
"used when references to DOM elements are sought. Instead, references are "
"stored within instances, on routes, and as dependencies. Don't use these "
"slow routines - they are designed for HTML."
msgstr ""

msgid "FAQ"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If on reading this FAQ you feel a question and answer is missing please "
"contact us."
msgstr ""

msgid "Email Us"
msgstr ""

msgid "Browser Compatibility"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Igaro App includes polyfills to maximise support for older browsers. Where a "
"browser doesn't provide a required feature the user is notified. Modules "
"define there own requirements, which are then enforced by the main loader. "
"Igaro App supports standardized web technology and won't target specific "
"browser types/features."
msgstr ""

msgid "Internet Explorer < 10"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for older versions of I.E (8/9) is possible but discouraged. You'll "
"need to regress features which can't be polyfilled such as SVG support."
msgstr ""

msgid "Android < 3"
msgstr ""

msgid "Due to lack of standard features, support is disabled by default."
msgstr ""

msgid "3rd Party Javascript Integration"
msgstr ""

msgid "Existing code can be rapidly integrated into the Igaro App framework."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generally speaking you may utilize all 3rd party libraries (i.e JQuery) with "
"the Igaro App framework. We've included several of the common ones in the "
"main repository."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dependencies"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Zero. Ziltch. Igaro App is entirely free of dependencies. It doesn't require "
"JQuery or any other third party library."
msgstr ""

msgid "Prototype or Classes?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Neither. Igaro App blesses Javascript Objects. See the core.bless module."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is Igaro App like x,y,z?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No. Frameworks like Angular, Backbone and React use HTML, data binding and "
"are inefficient. They appear powerful and easy to learn but fall flat when "
"you try to make a real App with them, and that's because they have been "
"designed to sell, not to do things right. There's a reason why Angular "
"'sponsored by Google' isn't used in any of Googles products."
msgstr ""

msgid "Features"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Igaro's architecture is build around several core principles, these provide "
"a layer on which everything else is built;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Javascript is a prototypal language. It's not Java and shouldn't be written "
"to mimick it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"HTML is a weak design language ill suited for dynamic operation. Therefore, "
"use no HTML."
msgstr ""

msgid "Child objects should report to parents. Events should fire up a chain."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Javascript specification must be adhered to. No functional duplicity or "
"prototyping onto internal objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Functions have the potential to be asynchronous, or emit an event which may "
"be so, therefore they should return Promises."
msgstr ""

msgid "These principles result in;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Flexability - expand on functions without rewriting them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Design - built on DOM manipulation, not HTML and hackwork."
msgstr ""

msgid "Encapsulation - code is compartmentalized."

"By default a route's view is appended into the parent route's view and "
