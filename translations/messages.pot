msgid "Asynchronous"
msgstr ""

msgid "Standard A+ Promises throughout, with an event driven architecture and sequencing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is <b>100%</b> asynchronous, using Promises."
msgstr ""

msgid "Most functions in Igaro App dispatch an event at the end of execution which includes a reference to itself and a value. While events are synchronous in chain and hierarchy, each event may contain asynchronous code. This is why most functions return a Promise."
msgstr ""

msgid "Promise Standard"
msgstr ""

msgid "Standard Promises (ES6, A+) are used throughout."
msgstr ""

msgid "Learn More"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sequencing"
msgstr ""

msgid "Unfortunately Promises can become verbose, especially for sequencing (applying the output from multiple Promises in the order they were supplied in). While future versions of Javascript attempt to address this, a standard is many years away."
msgstr ""

msgid "core.object provides promiseSequencer() to reduce promises in order while core.router's .addSequence() is similar but also appends DOM elements (or the container element for an instance)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Many instance modules provide pluralized creation functions, i.e .addItem() and addItems()."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bless"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App's bless decorates standard javascript objects providing two-way parent-child event management, managers, dependency tracking, abstraction, shared routines and dynamic functions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Most objects bless themselves, and most objects in Igaro are blessed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Usage"
msgstr ""

msgid "Blessing an object is straight forward. Many attributes are within the <b>o</b> literal and are passed through while a few are set on the object prior to blessing. See the core.object module for what this literal may contain."
msgstr ""

msgid "The .asRoot flag will be covered in the next chapter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parent"
msgstr ""

msgid "A reference to a parent object is stored on the child (while this introduces a circular dependency, it's taken care of when the object destructs)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Name"
msgstr ""

msgid "An object is given a name which can be used to uniquely identify it or it's type. Not to be confused with instanceof!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Path"
msgstr ""

msgid "A path is used to identify the objects location by way of it's hierarchical position. It's built using the name. Although an object may belong to another it's path may stop at the child, it doesn't necessarily have to resolve all the way to root. This is one usage of the .asRoot flag."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stash"
msgstr ""

msgid "Holds data that may not be attributes of the object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Managers"
msgstr ""

msgid "A manager is a module that uses the blessed decorations to enhance it's functions and/or to provide helper functions linking the blessed object as a dependency. Common managers include events, debugging, object creation and dom. Additional managers can be supplied at time of blessing, i.e if the module requires a store. Any module can offer a manager."
msgstr ""

msgid "Helpers"
msgstr ""

msgid "If a container is provided, helpers will be added to the object. These include show/hide and disable/inert."
msgstr ""

msgid "Destructor"
msgstr ""

msgid "A destructor is appended which when called will wipe dependencies, circular references, children, dom elements and events and will fire an event allowing dependents to do the same."
msgstr ""

msgid "Provides"
msgstr ""

msgid "What bless provides for an object depends on what was available and passed to it at the point of blessing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compatibiity"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App works with any recent browser and platform. This page contains the list."
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is compatible with all modern web browsers and mobile devices."
msgstr ""

msgid "Status"

msgid "Remarks"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some modules lack support, especially router's .pushState. Can be made to work with some overhead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Many modules lack workaround support for missing features that can't be prototyped. Can be made to work with significant overhead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tested as far back as version 10, but may work with earlier versions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tested as far back as version 40, but may work with earlier versions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tested as far back as version 15, but may work with earlier versions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mainly CSS related limitations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Missing support for many features, especially for CSS."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tested as far back as version 5, but may work with earlier versions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Contact"

msgid "Persons actively involved in Igaro App development have an email which is the quoted value found by their name followed by @igaro.com."

msgid "The <b>Freenode #igaro</b> channel is used by the developers to bounce around new ideas."
msgstr ""

msgid "If nobody is around ask your question and check back later for a reply."

msgid "Priority Service"

msgid "The priority service is offered to those requiring a guaranteed service level."

msgid "Members receive a unique email address and a response within a pre-agreed time frame."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enquire"
msgstr ""

msgid "Design"
msgstr ""

msgid "Only the best frameworks can do away with HTML. No templates or MVC, instead consistency and staggering performance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is <b>100%</b> HTML free."
msgstr ""

msgid "<s>.getElementById, .getElementsByClassName, .getElementsByTagName, .querySelector[all]</s> are designed for HTML and are slow. Don't use them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Templates"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App has no template engine, instead it uses routes to build entire pages and partials, and excellent CSS for design and layout."
msgstr ""

msgid "Eliminating HTML results in smarter code, consistency, higher rendering performance and no need for data binding."
msgstr ""

msgid "core.dom"
msgstr ""

msgid "Shorthand DOM element creation and appendation are provided by the core.dom module. Blessed objects gain a core.dom manager, which handles dependency tracking (i.e .destroy() your model and the dom elements disappear)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The .mk() function provided by core.dom creates elements, appends (or inserts before or after), sets content (can be a language literal) or appends other elements into it, and either sets the className or accepts a function."
msgstr ""

msgid "Events"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App's event management system tracks dependencies and propagates events up through parent objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is <b>100%</b> event driven."
msgstr ""

msgid "core.events is responsible for event management. It provides a manager to core.object's bless, which is used extensively to provide objects with an Event Emitter. Unlike the EventEmitter you may know from NodeJS, this one propagates events up to parents, supports Promises, and events track dependencies."
msgstr ""

msgid "on"
msgstr ""

msgid "This registers an event handle onto an emitter. It takes three arguments; the event name, a function, and an object literal. The object literal defines whether the event is prepended and which dependencies should be linked to the event. This allows you to 'bolt on' events to other objects' event emitters without worrying about memory release."
msgstr ""

msgid "dispatch"
msgstr ""

msgid "A dispatch may be sent with a value. If the object is a child 'car' of another object 'warehouse', the parent will also receive the dispatch."
msgstr ""

msgid "remove"
msgstr ""

msgid "This removes an event either by its registered function or a dependency."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Event Emitter"
msgstr ""

msgid "Event Termination"
msgstr ""

msgid "The event emitter supports either a rejected Promise or an object literal containing { stopImmediatePropagation:true }. To prevent propagation through parents, return { stopPropagation:true }."
msgstr ""

msgid "The .asRoot (see Bless) flag prevents a child event dispatching any further through a parent chain. It is mostly used by instances as a parent has no need for these dispatches. Some instances, such as instance.xhr fire events on the root emitter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example"
msgstr ""

msgid "At the bottom of this page is an instance.date formatted with moment.js. When you change the timezone or language of the this app using the settings icon at the top, moment.js has it's mode switched and instance.date.js refreshes it's DOM elements. Try it for yourself."
msgstr ""

msgid "Features"
msgstr ""

msgid "The highest performing Javascript framework - read to see what Igaro App offers you."
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro's architecture is build on several core principles;"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Javascript specification must be adhered to. No duplicity and use of standards throughout."
msgstr ""

msgid "HTML is a design language ill suited for dynamic operation. Therefore, use no HTML."
msgstr ""

msgid "Child objects should be able to communicate with parent objects and thus events should fire up a hierarchy."
msgstr ""

msgid "Most functions have a potential to be asynchronous, or emit an event which may be so, therefore they should return Promises."
msgstr ""

msgid "From these the foundation on which your app is built will feature;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Flexability - expand functions without appending code into them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Design - built on DOM, not HTML templating and slow parsing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Encapsulation - code is compartmentalized and abstracted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Security - no memory leaks or public variables."
msgstr ""

msgid "Resilience - smart error control, reporting, debugging and recovery."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compatibility - works in any modern web browser and across all devices."

msgid "Igaro App is <b>100%</b> secure."
msgstr ""

msgid "Initially index.html bootstraps igaro.js using a public variable. This is then removed and the only singular reference to the app is stored privately. Only modules loaded by Igaro App gain access to this variable, and since everything goes through it, the entire codebase is sandboxed from code injection."

msgid "OAuth2 Credentials"

msgid "Igaro App recommends using OAuth2 for authentication and provides a module, instance.oauth2, to make access to any provider simple."

msgid "Igaro App supports automated authentication transparent to code (which needs no handling) and the user (no URL change or redirection)."

msgid "An instance module exports a function which is instantiated upon need. Although you can use the Javascript <b>new</b> keyword to do this, core.object's bless (covered in the next chapter) provides a helper to lazy load the module, call <b>new</b> and then call a second constructor, .init(). Unlike <b>new</b>, .init() is asynchronous."
