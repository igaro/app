msgid "Welcome to <b>Igaro App</b>"
msgstr ""

msgid "Asynchronous"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is an asynchronous framework using Promises and Event Management to manage delayed notification and value convergence. Callbacks are a thing of the past, and most functions in Igaro App return Promises rather than values."
msgstr ""

msgid "This design choice was made for two reasons;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Most functions dispatch an event at the end of execution, which is an async operation. Step-over execution should only occur once registered handles for this event complete hence requiring the event Promise to be returned."
msgstr ""

msgid "Functions that are later modified to include asynchronous code break callers that expect a value. For compatibility with future code it is better to return a Promise even if the operation is not currently asynchronous."
msgstr ""

msgid "Promises"
msgstr ""

msgid "Standard Promises (ES6, A+) are used to replace callback routines. Promises allow for chainable asynchronous operation with error control and are native to modern browsers. Older browsers have a polyfill library loaded automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid "Event Management"
msgstr ""

msgid "Promises are for objects initiating work but not for when the object wishes to be notified when another object executes the work. To provide this feature Igaro App uses an event management system. Data and identifiers are returned to each registered party and are propagated vertically through parent objects. It works similarily to the native DOM event system, but it's for objects not elements!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App's event management system is cleaner than Object.observe() and signficiantly faster than any other framework's implementation. Events are linked to dependencies, which can be other objects or DOM elements and are automatically released, avoiding memory leaks by removing circular references and allowing Javascripts garbage collector to do it's job. The entire process is automatic."
msgstr ""

msgid "Any blessed object (most objects in Igaro App are blessed) gains an event manager."
msgstr ""

msgid "Design"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App offers a flexible design where everything is customizable, with structured SASS and folders to bootstrap your product."
msgstr ""

msgid "Router"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App isn't MVC. Traditionally, frameworks start with a view, assign a controller and this contains a model."
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App has a router, which begins at root, and loads route files. Route files encapsulate logic (controller) and are provided with a model template. They build the content of a view by either writing to the DOM or calling reuseable instance files."
msgstr ""

msgid "Multiple routes can be visible as a route doesn't necessarily have to be a navable via URL. Thus, the header, main and footer of a page are all routes. A route has children and events are propagated to parents."
msgstr ""

msgid "By default a route's view is appended to the parent route's view and fellow siblings are hidden. Routes are cached so if the user navigates to a different view outside of the current hierarchy they can return to it later with the same state."
msgstr ""

msgid "The router can be configured to use multiple sources. This app has routes defined through routes.* files but routing rules permit loading from a CDN (i.e close to the user's location) or an API (for dynamic views or secure content delivery) on a per request basis."
msgstr ""

msgid "Root"
msgstr ""

msgid "Header"
msgstr ""

msgid "Main"
msgstr ""

msgid "News content"
msgstr ""

msgid "footer"
msgstr ""

msgid "Templates"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App has no template engine, relying instead on reuseable modules and first-class CSS structure to define layouts. It's a radical way of working, but you'll love it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "DOM"
msgstr ""

msgid "core.dom provides DOM management, dependency tracking and event linkage. Any blessed object gains a core.dom manager. This manager works alongside the native DOM controls, and unlike JQuery it doesn't provide duplicatate functionality. It helps you to write highly structured, minimal code."
msgstr ""

msgid "These slow traversal routines are applicable when references to DOM elements are sought. With Igaro App references are stored within instances, on router models, and as dependencies. Subsequently, expect blistering performance compared to competing frameworks such as Angular and React."
msgstr ""

msgid "FAQ"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hopefully the following list will satisfy your query. If not, and you feel an answer should be included for the benefit of other users, hit the button below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Email Us"
msgstr ""

msgid "Browser Compatibility"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App includes polyfills to maximise support for older browsers. Where a browser doesn't provide a required feature the user is notified. Modules define there own requirements, which are then enforced by the main loader. Igaro App supports standardized web technology and won't target specific browser types/features."
msgstr ""

msgid "Internet Explorer < 10"
msgstr ""

msgid "Support for older versions of I.E (8/9) is possible but discouraged. You'll need to regress features which can't be polyfilled such as SVG support."
msgstr ""

msgid "Android < 3"
msgstr ""

msgid "Due to lack of standard features, support is disabled by default."
msgstr ""

msgid "Existing Javascript Integration"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can use existing code and rapidly integrate it into the Igaro App framework where you require use of it's advanced features."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can use generally utilize all 3rd party libraries (i.e JQuery, YetAnotherJS) with the Igaro App framework. We've included several of the common ones in the main repository."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dependencies"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is entirely free of dependencies. It doesn't require JQuery or any other third party library."
msgstr ""

msgid "Efficiency"
msgstr ""

msgid "As everything is built around an astonishingly efficient framework, your derived product, be it big or small, will scale and continue to work over time. And boy will it work fast! Oh, and flickering DOM updates are a thing of lesser frameworks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Learning Overhead"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is pure Javascript! It's one of the only frameworks that treats Javascript as the prototypal language that it is - there's no attempt to classify. If you know Javascript, then you're ready to develop with Igaro App. If not, and you learn Igaro App through studying it's examples and code, you'll learn about the very best of Javascript and cutting edge technique."
