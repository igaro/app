msgid "Asynchronous"
msgstr ""

msgid "Standard A+ Promises throughout, with an event driven architecture and sequencing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is <b>100%</b> asynchronous, using Promises."
msgstr ""

msgid "Most functions in Igaro App dispatch an event at the end of execution which includes a reference to itself and a value. While events are synchronous in chain and hierarchy, each event may contain asynchronous code. This is why most functions return a Promise."
msgstr ""

msgid "Promise Standard"
msgstr ""

msgid "Standard Promises (ES6, A+) are used throughout."
msgstr ""

msgid "Learn More"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sequencing"
msgstr ""

msgid "Unfortunately Promises can become verbose, especially for sequencing (applying the output from multiple Promises in the order they were supplied in). While future versions of Javascript attempt to address this, a standard is many years away."
msgstr ""

msgid "core.object provides promiseSequencer() to reduce promises in order while core.router's .addSequence() is similar but also appends DOM elements (or the container element for an instance)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Many instance modules provide pluralized creation functions, i.e .addItem() and addItems()."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bless"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App's bless decorates standard javascript objects providing two-way parent-child event management, managers, dependency tracking, abstraction, shared routines and dynamic functions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Most objects bless themselves, and most objects in Igaro are blessed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Usage"
msgstr ""

msgid "Blessing an object is straight forward. Many attributes are within the <b>o</b> literal and are passed through. See the core.object module for what this literal may contain."
msgstr ""

msgid "The .asRoot flag will be covered in the next chapter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parent"
msgstr ""

msgid "A reference to a parent object is stored on the child (while this introduces a circular dependency, it's taken care of when the object destructs)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Name"
msgstr ""

msgid "An object is given a name which can be used to uniquely identify it or it's type. Not to be confused with instanceof!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Path"
msgstr ""

msgid "A path is used to identify the objects location by way of it's hierarchical position. It's built using the name. Although an object may belong to another it's path may stop at the child, it doesn't necessarily have to resolve all the way to root. This is one usage of the .asRoot flag."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stash"
msgstr ""

msgid "Holds data that may not be attributes of the object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Managers"
msgstr ""

msgid "A manager is a module that uses the blessed decorations to enhance it's functions and/or to provide helper functions linking the blessed object as a dependency. Common managers include events, debugging, object creation and dom. Additional managers can be supplied at time of blessing, i.e if the module requires a store. Any module can offer a manager."
msgstr ""

msgid "Helpers"
msgstr ""

msgid "If a container is provided, helpers will be added to the object. These include show/hide and disable/inert."
msgstr ""

msgid "Destructor"
msgstr ""

msgid "A destructor is appended which when called will wipe dependencies, circular references, children, dom elements and events and will fire an event allowing dependents to do the same."
msgstr ""

msgid "Provides"
msgstr ""

msgid "What bless provides for an object depends on what was available and passed to it at the point of blessing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compatibiity"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App works with any recent browser and platform. This page contains the list."
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is compatible with all modern web browsers and mobile devices."
msgstr ""

msgid "Modules are responsible for verifying requirements upon load. Upon an error a message is displayed to the user."

msgid "Version"
msgstr ""

msgid "Status"
msgstr ""

msgid "Remarks"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some modules lack support, especially router's .pushState. Can be made to work with some overhead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Many modules lack workaround support for missing features that can't be prototyped. Can be made to work with significant overhead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tested as far back as version 10, but may work with earlier versions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tested as far back as version 15, but may work with earlier versions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mainly CSS related limitations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Missing support for many features, especially for CSS."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tested as far back as version 5, but may work with earlier versions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some missing features and many CSS issues. Not recommended."

msgid "Contact"
msgstr ""

msgid "Persons actively involved in Igaro App development have an email which is the quoted value found by their name followed by @igaro.com."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lead Developers"
msgstr ""

msgid "The <b>Freenode #igaro</b> channel is used by the developers to bounce around new ideas."
msgstr ""

msgid "If nobody is around ask your question and check back later for a reply."

msgid "Enquire"
msgstr ""

msgid "Design"
msgstr ""

msgid "Only the best frameworks can do away with HTML. No templates or MVC, instead consistency and staggering performance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is <b>100%</b> HTML free."
msgstr ""

msgid "<s>.getElementById, .getElementsByClassName, .getElementsByTagName, .querySelector[all]</s> are designed for HTML and are slow. Don't use them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Templates"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App has no template engine, instead it uses routes to build entire pages and partials, and excellent CSS for design and layout."
msgstr ""

msgid "Eliminating HTML results in smarter code, consistency, higher rendering performance and no need for data binding."
msgstr ""

msgid "core.dom"
msgstr ""

msgid "Shorthand DOM element creation and appendation are provided by the core.dom module. Blessed objects gain a core.dom manager, which handles dependency tracking (i.e .destroy() your model and the dom elements disappear)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The .mk() function provided by core.dom creates elements, appends (or inserts before or after), sets content (can be a language literal) or appends other elements into it, and either sets the className or accepts a function."
msgstr ""

msgid "Events"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App's event management system tracks dependencies and fires events up through parent objects. It's hugely powerful."
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is <b>100%</b> event driven."
msgstr ""

msgid "core.events is responsible for event management. It provides a manager to core.object's bless, and this is used extensively throughout the Igaro App framework."
msgstr ""

msgid "Typically taken from the object path attribute, as defined by core.object's bless."
msgstr ""

msgid "Typically matches the name of the executing function."
msgstr ""

msgid "Target"
msgstr ""

msgid "Defines if any event is for a particular object. Using the event manager provided by core.object's bless sets this automatically to the object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dependencies"
msgstr ""

msgid "Allows the event to be cleaned/deregistered when any of the dependencies are destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Value"
msgstr ""

msgid "Any value passed to the event and a reference to the target if applicable."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Dispatch"
msgstr ""

msgid "Parent & Children"
msgstr ""

msgid "When an event dispatches on a child it propagates up through the parent. A rejected Promise or a literal containing stopPropagation can abort this."
msgstr ""

msgid "As the event propagates the path and name change. This allows parents to listen for child events. For example an object with parent 'materials' of name 'metal' which dispatches an event of 'cut' of value true, will also dispatch an event on 'materials' called 'metal.cut'. The value will be replaced with a child reference and original value."
msgstr ""

msgid "The .asRoot() flag prevents a child event dispatching on the parent. It is mostly used by instances. A parent has no need for these dispatches since it can access the instance event manager directly."
msgstr ""

msgid "By Instance/Singleton"
msgstr ""

msgid "Listening to events on modules is accomplished by accessing the event manager on the object and calling extend on it. This adds your object as a dependency (should it later be destroyed the event will be cleaned up automatically)."
msgstr ""

msgid "(object).managers.event.extend(this).on('eventName',fn);"
msgstr ""

msgid "By Path/Type"
msgstr ""

msgid "Listening to the event manager on an instance will only provide events for that particular instance, not the instance type."
msgstr ""

msgid "In this App, each time an instance.xhr start and end event fire a tally is kept and an icon is displayed in the header. This is an example of monitoring by type and is accomplished via core.events and not through a manager. route.header.js shows how this is done."
msgstr ""

msgid "app['core.events'].on('instance.xhr','start',fn);"
msgstr ""

msgid "Features"
msgstr ""

msgid "The highest performing Javascript framework - read to see what Igaro App offers you."
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro's architecture is build on several core principles;"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Javascript specification must be adhered to. No duplicity and use of standards throughout."
msgstr ""

msgid "HTML is a design language ill suited for dynamic operation. Therefore, use no HTML."
msgstr ""

msgid "Child objects should be able to communicate with parent objects and thus events should fire up a hierarchy."
msgstr ""

msgid "Most functions have a potential to be asynchronous, or emit an event which may be so, therefore they should return Promises."
msgstr ""

msgid "From these the foundation on which your app is built will feature;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Flexability - expand functions without appending code into them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Design - built on DOM, not HTML templating and slow parsing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Encapsulation - code is compartmentalized and abstracted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Security - no memory leaks or public variables."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is <b>100%</b> MVC free."
msgstr ""

msgid "Most users will use the core.router module to serve pages. This router is dynamic, it begins at root and loads further routes as children. A route builds content by either appending elements or embedding instances."

msgid "For the example above 'books' and 'pages' are routes. The book route must capture the book id and show details of the book. The router then skips this id and loads pages as a route. This does the same, and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid "The router doesn't load routes directly. Instead it iterates a list of providers which handle one or more or all routes, and which when called returns the physically location of the route. Thus, the books route could be loaded from a web server in one location, while pages could load from an API in another. This is transparent to the user and forms the basis of Igaro App's ability to serve dynamic content from an API."

msgid "URI data for a route is accessible on the route. This allows for quick hyperlinking to child routes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Partials"
msgstr ""

msgid "A route can load child routes as partials without assigning a URL."

msgid "Igaro App is the only Javascript Framework with zero public variables, effectively sandboxing it's libraries from code injection."
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App is <b>100%</b> secure."
msgstr ""

msgid "Initially index.html bootstraps igaro.js using a public variable. This is then removed and the only singular reference to the app is stored privately. Only modules loaded by Igaro App gain access to this variable, and since everything goes through it, the entire codebase is sandboxed from code injection."
msgstr ""

msgid "OAuth2 Credentials"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App recommends using OAuth2 for authentication and provides a module, instance.oauth2, to make access to any provider simple."
msgstr ""

msgid "Automated Authentication"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro App supports automated authentication transparent to code (which needs no handling) and the user (no URL change or redirection)."
msgstr ""

msgid "A service which requires credentials emits a HTTP 401 which is captured and invokes an OAuth2 mechanism. Once complete the previous request and any that have came in since are then completed."

msgstr ""

msgid "Configures the app, modules, and bridge events. They don't provide functionality or output to the DOM."
msgstr ""

msgid "Libraries, not instantiable, which provide global functionality. Typically required by other modules via module.requires. Don't contain language or output to the DOM."

msgstr ""

msgid "Translation files produced by the compiler and translation files generated by translators are stored here and merged upon the build process."

msgid "Module Layout"
msgstr ""

msgid "Igaro modules export code via module.export while 3rd party code (i.e JQuery) may not. All have access to the app (private) and global settings (public) variable, so only load modules from locations you trust."
msgstr ""

msgid "The name of the module dicatates its namespace in the app, i.e for type.name.js, what is exported will be available in app['type.name']."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dependencies can be added to the requires list. Instance modules can be lazy loaded (initial load speed -v- possible lag later on, your call) and don't need to be added. A custom server/cdn can be supplied along with the module name (not shown)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Instances"
msgstr ""

msgid "Instances (also know as widgets) can be called anything, but Igaro supplied instances are denoted by an instance.* filename."
msgstr ""

msgid "An instance module exports a function which is instantiated upon need. Although you can use the Javascript <b>new</b> keyword to do this, core.object's bless (covered in the next chapter) provides a helper to lazy load the module, call <b>new</b> and then call a second constructor, .init(). Unlike <b>new</b>, .init() is asynchronous."
